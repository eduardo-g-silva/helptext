A Yii 2 log target for streams in URL format.

This log target allows you to log to any of the URL like targets that are
[supported by PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php). Typical use cases
are docker containers that often log to `STDOUT` and `STDERR`, in which case
the target urls would be `php://stdout` and `php://stderr` respectively.
